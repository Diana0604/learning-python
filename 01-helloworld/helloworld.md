# Helloworld
## Step by Step
- Create a new python file using the commandline
- To do that, use the following command: `touch helloworld.py`. The file should appear on the workspace menu.
- Open the file `helloworld.py`
- Write the following line of code:
```python
print("hello world")
```
- From the terminal, use the following command: `python helloworld.py`
- Congratulations! You have created your program.
## What happened?
- We have used a `method` called `print`.
- This method tells python that we want to display on the terminal whatever is between brackets
## Observation
- The quotation marks are important. Try taking them out and see what happens! (fun). Will explain in next lesson why they are important.
