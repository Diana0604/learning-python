# Calculator
## What we want
A functional calculator. It will have
- A method called `greet` that greets the user upon turning on. It will need **one** input.
- Methods called `sum`, `substract`, `multiply`, `divide` which respectively do what they say. It will need **two** inputs.
- Use the file called `calculator.py` for this

## IMPORTANT
It is important that you use the names I specified. To try it, run the file `manager.py` with `python manager.py`
